# Aggregates Are Microservices

Aggregates in the context of domain-driven design (DDD) are a pattern used to model and organize domain logic in a microservices architecture. An aggregate is a group of related domain objects that are treated as a single unit. In DDD, an aggregate defines a boundary around a set of objects and their relationships, and it enforces a set of invariants that must be maintained for the aggregate to be in a consistent state.

This aligns well with the microservices architectural pattern, which emphasizes the division of a system into small, independent, and loosely-coupled services. By modeling microservices as aggregates, it allows for a clear separation of concerns and encapsulation of data within each service, which in turn make it easier to understand, test, and evolve the service independently. It also facilitates distribution and scalability of a system. This is why many microservices architectures use the aggregate pattern to organize the business logic and data within their services.
